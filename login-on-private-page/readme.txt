Redirects logged out users to the login page when accessing a private page or post.

== Description ==

The default WordPress behaviour for serving private pages/posts to logged out users is to return a 404. 
This plugin changes that behaviour to return a redirect to the login page, with a proper action. 
The login page then shows a message to the user, so that he may login and view the protected content.

This plugin does not change the hidden property of private pages and posts. They will not appear on searches
or on lists.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the plugin archive
1. Move the plugin directory to wp-content/plugins/
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Done. No configuration is required.
